# Tic-Tac-Toe-with-AI
Try making your own version before lookin at my final version that uses the textbook implemetation. I would instead look at the bad version to know what works, but is self admittedly lazy at the same time.

the second algorithm I've ever "written."
play Tic Tac Toe vs a cpu, starting player is random.
can be changed to play cpu vs cpu. both the "bad" and "good" versions of the cpu can be played

# updated v2
the two newest commits are a good implementation of the cpu and the game state vs a human player 

TTT is the game script the other is the eval script for the cpu.


# The CPU's for the game
Run TTT-GameState.py to play, 

I have 2 different cpu's 

nether can be beaten both are completely different approaches to writing the algorithm which will tie or beat all human players
