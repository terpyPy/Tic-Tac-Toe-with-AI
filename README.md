# Tic-Tac-Toe-with-AI
Try making your own version before lookin at my final version that uses the textbook implemetation. I would instead look at the bad version to know what works, but is self admittedly lazy at the same time.

the second algorithm I've ever "written."
play Tic Tac Toe vs a cpu, starting player is random.
can be changed to play cpu vs cpu.

# updated v2
the two newest commits are a good implemetation of the cpu and the game state vs a human player TTT is the game script the other is the eval script for the cpu.
