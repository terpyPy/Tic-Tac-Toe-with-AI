# Tic-Tac-Toe-with-AI
the second algorithm I've ever "written."
play Tic Tac Toe vs a cpu, starting player is random.
can be changed to play cpu vs cpu.

# updated v2
the two newest commits are a good implemetation of the cpu and the game state vs a human player TTT is the game script the other is the eval script for the cpu.
